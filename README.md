## 🌟 What the app Does

Built a **30-day writing challenge app** that motivates users to develop a daily writing habit. The app presents:

- **30 day-specific buttons**, each representing a unique writing prompt.
- A **locked progression system** where users must meet a word goal to unlock the next day.
- A **save and return later** feature to support writing at your own pace.
- Built-in **hints, examples, and tone suggestions** to overcome writer’s block.
- A **simple, elegant UI** optimized for all devices and screen sizes.

## 🎯 Why Built This

Writing consistently is hard — especially when distractions and creative blocks get in the way. I wanted to build a tool that:

- Encourages **daily, bite-sized writing** with clear goals.
- Helps users stay on track with **visual progression**.
- Removes clutter and lets users **focus purely on writing**.
- Provides **gentle nudges and creative support** (like hints and tone suggestions).
- Makes it easy to **pause and return later** without losing progress.

My goal was to create an environment that promotes **consistency, creativity, and clarity** — all within a minimalist and motivating interface.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 📅 Daily Prompt System
- The app features **30 buttons**, one for each day.
- Below each button is a word or theme that previews the day’s writing prompt.
- Initially, only **Day 1 is unlocked**. Completing each day's goal unlocks the next.

### 🧠 Prompt Details and Writing Interface
- Clicking an unlocked day reveals:
  - A **title** and **detailed prompt**
  - A **word goal** (e.g., 200 words)
  - **Tags** to give quick insight into the topic
  - A **large, focused text area** for typing
  - A **live word count tracker**
  - Real-time feedback:  
    - “**Keep going...**” if you're under the limit  
    - “**Great!**” when you reach the target  
    - “**Too long**” if you go over (continue is disabled)

### 💡 Creative Support
- Hovering over the prompt reveals a **hint icon**.
- Clicking it opens a **modal** with:
  - A **hint** for approaching the prompt
  - A **sample paragraph**
  - A suggested **tone or writing style**

### 💾 Save and Exit
- At any point, users can click **Save and Exit** to store progress.
- They can return anytime and pick up where they left off.

### 🎨 Design and UX
- The app uses a **clean, responsive UI** — no ads, no clutter.
- Typography, spacing, and visual cues are designed to reduce cognitive load and **keep users in the writing flow**.
- Built with a **mobile-first** approach for accessibility across devices.
